Project Features Summary
This project is a live data dashboard developed using React.js, which connects to several public APIs to display real-time information. The APIs used are:
- TMDb (The Movie Database) for fetching movie details.
- Open Library for retrieving book data.
- OpenWeather for accessing current weather information.

Main Features:
1. API Connections:
   - The dashboard gathers data from open APIs, including movie information from TMDb, book details from Open Library, and weather conditions from OpenWeather, and presents them on the interface.
  
2. Interactive Category Selection:
   - Users can switch between different types of data—movies, books, or weather—allowing them to explore and visualize information across multiple categories.

3. Sorting Functionality:
   - Data can be sorted based on criteria such as rating (for movies and books) or temperature (for weather), giving users the ability to view the highest-rated or most relevant information.

4. Data Visualization:
   - The dashboard employs bar charts (using Chart.js) to represent the data graphically, providing users with an easy-to-read visual of the selected data, such as movie ratings or weather temperatures.

5. Real-Time Interaction:
   - The displayed data and charts automatically update in response to user actions, such as changing categories or sorting, ensuring that the information remains relevant and up-to-date.
